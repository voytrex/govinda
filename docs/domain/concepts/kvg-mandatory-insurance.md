## Special Situations

### Accident Coverage (UVG)

- Employees are covered by employer's accident insurance (UVG)
- They can **exclude** accident from KVG (lower premium)
- Self-employed/unemployed: accident must be **included** in KVG

```
Employee (> 8h/week):     KVG WITHOUT accident  (cheaper)
                          UVG covers accidents

Self-employed/Unemployed: KVG WITH accident     (more expensive)
                          No UVG coverage
```

### Premium Subsidies (Prämienverbilligung)

- Low-income residents can receive cantonal subsidies
- Amount varies by canton
- Apply through cantonal authority, not insurer
